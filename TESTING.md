# TESTING STEPS

## User story testing:
1. **As a fan of new and retro sneakers** I am looking for a website where I can share my interest in sneakers with other sneaker fans. Having found the SNEAKERFANS website this allows me to do just that. I can use the browse collection search bar to check for all types of sneakers and to give me great ideas for my next purchase.

2. **As a sneaker collector** I am looking for a website where I can find ideas to add my exstensive collection of sneakers. The SNEAKERFANS website allows me to see sneakers I did not realise were realeased. Everything from vintage to signature and retro releases are available to view on SNEAKERFANS. I especially enjoy photographing my own collection and adding them to the database.

3. **As the website owner** I would like to create a community of sneaker lovers who can share images and information on popular and extremely rare sneakers. The website does exactly what it says on the tin. New users are signing up each day and sharing their passion for sneakers. It is easy to sign up and add your sneakers in a matter of minutes

4. **As a sneaker retailer** I created an account with the SNEAKERFANS website. It allows me to see what sneakers people enjoy and it also gives me great ideas for rare releases I can add to my store to stand out from my competitors. I would love if I had a way of seeing what sneakers are trending on the site based on how many views a sneaker has or how many likes it has. I have spoken to the website owner and they have assured me this is a feature they will soon be adding. I would definately pay a suscription for this type of information. It would help me boost sales and stay ahead of the curve.
